Happening is an Events based Social Network and Advertising platform. Today, there is a need for an important Events finder on the Georgia Tech campus, and we intend on creating the first unified resource for finding them

There are 3 areas of this project:
  1. Android - The Primary app. This app has nearly finished completetion, and will be released as part of a Beta test to Georgia Tech students.
  2. iOS     - This app is currently under development. We intend to finish this app in the next coming months.
  3. Web     - This app has finished completion. It is written with a Node.js server and with HTML5. This sub-repository also contains the Backend code for this project.
